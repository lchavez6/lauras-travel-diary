              After having moved to America when I was 5 years old, I realized
              that traveling would always be an important part of my life. As I
              got older, I looked forward to the plane rides and imagined my
              life as an adult when I would be able to choose any destination I
              desired. I knew I didn’t want to travel alone, but at 22, I
              finally got the chance to travel alone, and it was an experience
              that changed my life. I’d done a lot more traveling before turning
              22, but it was always with a partner. I didn’t think I had
              anything to prove to myself, but this solo trip ended up being my
              favorite because it is where I learned to enjoy my own company.
              <br />I have created this travel diary to document some of my
              favorite travel destinations and memories. Traveling has shaped
              who I am, and I would like to share this with other people so that
              they can be inspired to travel alone or go to a destination that
              perhaps wasn’t too appealing beforehand.

            My best friend from high school had moved back to Brazil during our
            freshman year and I missed her a lot. I didn’t have many friends
            growing up, so when my mom asked me what I wanted for my graduation
            present, I didn’t hesitate. I wanted a trip to visit my best friend.
            I planned this trip for a major part of my senior year, and I would
            often look at pictures of what the country looked like. I thought
            maybe it couldn’t be much different than Colombia except for the
            different language, and I feel like I was somewhat right.
            <br />I took a United flight sometime in June, and I remember it
            took almost 10 hours to get there on a non-stop flight! During the
            flight, they showed pictures of the many different parts of Brazil
            and although I knew I wouldn’t be leaving the capital, I kept
            imagining that I would. Some of the parts that most intrigued me
            were Rio de Janeiro, especially Ipanema. It’s interesting how things
            are connected because later in college I took a music class, and I
            heard this song called “Girl from Ipanema” and I felt so worldly!
            Looking back, I wish I could have explored more on my own, but I was
            too scared back then. I want to go back to Brazil and go see the
            Iguazu waterfalls. My grandparents visited them during their
            honeymoon, and I want to see them too. Anyways, getting back to
            Brazil. <br />I landed Guarulhos International Airport, and it was
            much more humid than I could have imagined. My friend picked me up
            on a big bus, which was a new experience for me. After getting back
            to her house, we went out for lunch and although I don’t remember
            what we ate, I do remember we enjoyed many Guaranas which is a
            ginger ale like beverage except 100 times better! <br />I was a
            little disappointed that Sao Paulo was like a big metropolis, but I
            do remember admiring the high-rise buildings. During my time here,
            my friend took me to Sushi and told me that there a big Japanese
            population in this city.

            One of my favorite movies is Lost in Translation and the inside of
            the Sushi restaurant reminded me of this. Prior to eating here, I
            thought Sushi was just a California roll and boy, was I wrong!

            My trip was short, and my friend felt bad that we couldn’t go to too
            many places while I was there, so she planned a trip with some of
            her other friends to a Cunha. It was a little bit far away by car
            ride and I was never huge into hiking or going camping, but my
            friend said I would like it, so I went. It was funny because the
            World Cup was taking place during time, and we didn’t even get
            tickets! While I was in Cunha though, I watched some of the games,
            and even cried a little bit when James Rodriguez cried as he lost to
            Brazil. Colombia was so close to winning!

            The exterior of the house where we stayed in Cunha. This mini
            getaway felt very homely and although I feared being so far from
            home, I felt very excited and independent.

            My friend’s parents loved to travel a lot and I remember seeing this
            on their fridge. I hope I can have a fridge as full as this one, one
            day.

            After I got back from Brazil that summer, I started going to school
            at George Mason in August. I didn’t travel much during the two years
            I spent at Mason, but this all changed when I moved to Tampa,
            Florida in 2016. I loved living in Tampa because there was so much
            to do. My favorite place to visit, besides the beach, was Ginnie
            Springs! Anyways, one day I was searching to see what flights to
            some places I wanted to visit cost, and I was pleasantly surprised
            that you could go just about anywhere, for cheap, out of the Orlando
            airport. <br />
            I continued my undergraduate degree at The University of South
            Florida. However, I had to wait one year to receive in state
            tuition. While I was waiting, I planned two trips. One to Cancun,
            Mexico and the other to Europe. I was a woman on a mission! I spent
            three days in Cancun and about a month after coming back, I
            convinced my then boyfriend to visit 5 European countries with me in
            11 days. We’d bought new sneakers before our trip, and the soles
            were completely worn by the time we returned from Europe.
          </p>
          <p>
            Looking back at my pictures, I’m sad to find that I don’t have many
            pictures from my Mexico trip. The beach was so beautiful! But I do
            have some from the tourist dolphin swim and the Cenote’s tour I did
            as well.

            Europe was always a dream of mine. I’ve always wanted to see the
            Eiffel tower, the colosseum, and the various museums throughout. I
            knew that planning to visit so many countries in such a short period
            was a big undertaking, but I was ready. I planned the itinerary for
            months and everything went quite smoothly, besides not being able to
            see the Anne Frank house. One of my favorite artists is Van Gogh so
            I really loved going to see his artwork in France. For this trip, I
            flew out of MCO (Orlando) and had a layover in Manchester. After the
            layover, I landed in Amsterdam, and it was like something out of a
            movie. The air smelled so clean, and although it was still a little
            cold and a grey, I managed to have a wonderful time. The first night
            there I remember that we were outside walking around 11pm at night
            and there was still sunlight! The highlights of Amsterdam were
            Rembrandt Square, the coffee houses, The Heineken Experience, Madame
            Tussaud’s wax museum, The Lookout (Europe’s highest swing at the
            time), and the Rijksmuseum.

            I loved the look of the houses in Amsterdam, they were actually very
            similar to the houses in Copenhagen, Denmark.

            We quickly changed scenery after a couple of days and landed in
            Rome. What I enjoyed most about Rome aside from the weather, was how
            welcoming the people were. It reminded me a lot of Colombia. I also
            found their cuisine exquisite and appreciated that we could drink a
            carafe of wine for 5 euros. While here, the highlights were being
            able to visit the Vatican City and see its museums, where
            Michelangelo totally blew us away. I also loved seeing the statues
            and the Galleria Borghese. The artists I admired most were
            Caravaggio and Correggio.
          </p>

            What was most impressive about the sculptures were the details. I
            remember on one of them, you could see the imprint of the man’s
            fingers on the woman’s thighs, and it was stunning to know that this
            artwork had survived so many years. <br />
            One of my favorite art pieces was the Pieta, which is the virgin
            Mary carrying the body of Christ.

            After eating our way throughout Rome, we soon left and landed in
            Paris. It was a late flight and I felt so happy to be greeted by the
            shining Eiffel tower. The first time I saw it light up, I cried
            because I felt successful in making my dreams come true. The food
            was also really good in Paris, and my favorite were the escargot.
            Some of the highlights from this city were the Catacombs, the Louvre
            Museum, the Palace of Versailles, Notre Dame, the cruise on the
            Siene, and being able to go to the top of the Eiffel tower where we
            enjoyed glasses of champagne.

            After leaving Paris, we landed in Copenhagen. We didn’t have much
            planned for this city, except seeing the Little Mermaid. We also
            wanted to take the Oresund bridge to cross over into Sweden, and the
            train because the tunnel went underwater. I can’t remember much
            about Sweden aside from its grey atmosphere, and Copenhagen wasn’t
            too impressive either aside from the famous Nyhvan neighborhood. The
            houses were so quaint!

            After being away for so long during the Europe trip, I wanted to
            take a few more short trips with beach and relaxation involved. When
            I turned 21, I bought tickets to go to Montego Bay and I stayed at
            Sunset at The Palms. The beach there was so calm. Everyone was
            friendly and the food was delicious. I remember jumping off the
            cliffs in the ocean, snorkeling, going to Rick’s café, and spending
            a day on the party boat/catamaran. This vacation though, was very
            similar to a trip I planned two years later to Punta Cana in the DR
            which is why I have grouped these together. The main difference
            between these trips is that the heat/ sun in DR was much hotter and
            intense. Also, the people in DR were all about the party and
            drinking, whereas the Jamaicans were much more laid back. I recently
            took a trip to Puerto Rico to celebrate my graduation. I think at
            this point I have concluded that most tropical places are the same.
            If you’ve seen one, you’ve seen them all. Doesn’t mean they’re not
            fun though!

            My most recent trip was to San Juan, Puerto Rico in May of 2023. I
            think that alongside traveling, I also want to meet new animals. My
            next trip, although I’m not sure when it is going to happen, will be
            to South Africa. <br />
            San, Juan was a dream come true because I finally got to swim with
            the sea turtles. I also got to hike all across the Yunke national
            rainforest and see the bioluminescence.

            A little out of chronological order, but I have included my China
            trip last because it was the most freeing. I had to travel to Los
            Angeles to catch a flight into Beijing in November of 2019 over
            Thanksgiving weekend. I spent a few days in LA surfing and seeing
            some landmarks. I also went on a mini cruise and got to see many of
            the seals in Long Beach before I made my way over to China. The
            flight was nonstop, but it was almost sixteen hours! When I landed
            in Beijing, I got some lunch and was surprised to know that they had
            a knock off version of red bull in small weirdly shaped cans for a
            couple of Yen. My biggest surprise upon landing was that they had
            squatting toilets. I never used one, I was too intimidated. The trip
            to China was very long as well. It was almost 11 days where I got to
            go all around China. This was also my first time traveling alone. I
            was scared but ended up having a great time. The highlights of my
            trip were seeing the Shanghai Skyline, climbing The Great Wall in
            Beijing, going to the Forbidden City, and seeing the Chinese Opera.
            I wasn’t too impressed with traditional Chinese food but loved the
            duck and the dim sum.

            It was also winter in China, so I was greeted by a mini snow storm
            that turned everything much prettier.
